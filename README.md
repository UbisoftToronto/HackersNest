# SheHacks 5 Challenge

Demonstrate your abilities as a game developer and take us on a journey! Our mentors will help you succeed by providing hands on demonstrations, documentation and consultations along the way. 

**Please attend our workshop from 10PM to 11PM EST on Friday, Jan 8th** and visit our Hopin booth and Slack channel to meet our mentors Claire Girvin, Ramon Viladomat, and Susie Su.

You must choose at least **ONE** mechanic/theme from the following list to be included in your game:

* One button game
* 60 second game
* Keep it alive!
* 1 v 1
  * Local multiplayer
* Everything is reversed!
  * For example, winning is for losers.
  * What else can you reverse in a game? Get creative!
* The more you have, the worse it is!
* Pong
  * How can you remake this classic arcade game with a twist?
