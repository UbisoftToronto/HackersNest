# HackTheNorth Challenge

Demonstrate your abilities as a game developer and take us on a journey! Our mentors will help you succeed by providing hands on demonstrations, documentation and consultations along the way.

**Please attend our workshop from 5PM to 5:30PM EST on Friday, Jan 15th** and visit our Hopin booth and Discord channel to meet our mentors Radoslaw Malicki, Nikhil Ramburrun, Xavier Sadoulet and Kevin Jeong.

In order to be eligible for the prize, your game must be using our API in C++. You must choose at least **ONE** mechanic/theme from the following list to be included in your game:

* One button game
* 60 second game
* Keep it alive!
* 1 v 1
* Local multiplayer
* Everything is reversed!
  * For example, winning is for losers.
  * What else can you reverse in a game? Get creative!
* The more you have, the worse it is!
* Pong
  * How can you remake this classic arcade game with a twist?
